# NYT Visual
Truth through images.

## Description
NYT Visual is a new way for The New York Times readers to digest the news in a less overwhelming, more visually concentrated manner. This iOS app uses images taken by The New York Times photographers to provide a gateway into articles related to each photo's topic. By displaying only enough text to provide context for each image, NYT Visual allows readers to learn more about current issues through visual storytelling, and links each to an article to delve further into each topic.
